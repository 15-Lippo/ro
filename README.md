# Everdeen
[Everdeen](https://everdeen-app.herokuapp.com/#/) is a faithful clone of Robinhood, a stock investing web application. However, Everdeen allows you to invest for free, so that users may learn how to invest and follow stocks without the pressure of losing real money. This project was conceptualized and built in 10 days. Noteworthy technologies used: Ruby on Rails and React/Redux. Read on more to find out about the APIs I used and approaches I took to solving the problems I faced.
